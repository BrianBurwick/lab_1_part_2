            NASA announced early Monday morning that over the past weekend the source of the "Hum of the Universe" was discovered to be a neighboring alien civilization from a nearby galaxy. Scientists are currently unable to translate the contents of the message and a global effort is currently underway with language specialists and artifical intelligence in order to attempt to understand them. The President of the United States is set to hold a press briefing on Tuesday morning at 9:00am with the head of NASA to answer questions and provide additional information.
